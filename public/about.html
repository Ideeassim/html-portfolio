<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a full stack Web Developer with knowledge of front end and back end wed developing. 
  I enjoy undertaking challenging products that make me think outside the box.
I studied Pharmacy while in Uni and practised as a pharmacist but I decided 
to make a transition to tech because tech allows me to showcase my creativity. I like to
build things from the scratch and web developing gives me this opportuniy.</p>
